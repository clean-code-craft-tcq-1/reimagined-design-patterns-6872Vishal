# reimagined-design-patterns

Give a summary description of Four design patterns that you choose from the following design patterns: **Adapter,  Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, Interpreter, State, Mediator, Memento, Prototype, Proxy**. In your summaries say:

- what kind of problem(s) you can solve with that pattern and when you use it, maybe with a short example
- how the pattern works, what the basic idea of the pattern is
- what the main advantage and what the the main disadvantage is of using this pattern
- Write a short summary for each of the four patterns, about half a page for each pattern (rather less than more). 

> Do not add diagrams, and do not try to give a complete description of the patterns as found in the books. Rather think of how you would explain the essential ideas of these patterns in a few sentences to a colleague while drinking coffee.

Adapter Design Pattern:
The Adapter design pattern allows incompatible classes to interact with each other by converting the interface of one class into an interface excepted by other.
Example :
Now consider you are travelling to Europe with laptop, the standard power cable doesn't fit in european socket. So what do we do? , buy a adapter which acts as a interface between the socket and power cable.Now the same can be applicable in coding. Instead of making changes to existing code, we add new interface which acts as a adapter.

Advantage:
Improve's the reusability of older functionality.
Disadvantage:
The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes itâ€™s simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest of your code.
